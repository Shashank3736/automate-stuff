# My Automations
## Look at my download folder
You are active on the internet you download stuffs but after sometime you see that it is really hard to find the files you actually need. So, I wrote a python script which
checks all my current files in Downloads folder and arrange them by it's type. Also the code stays alive to watch over the download folder so the moment you download something it
will place stuff directly into the desired place.
